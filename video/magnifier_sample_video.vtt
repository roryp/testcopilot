NOTE Confidence: 0.8552657961845398

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.765
Hello everyone, I'm Balendu Sharma and I would like to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8552657961845398

00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:08.049
take you through an accessibility tool which has been part

NOTE Confidence: 0.8552657961845398

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:11.501
of Windows for many decades but which has undergone important

NOTE Confidence: 0.8552657961845398

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:14.339
changes in the recent past. The tool is magnifier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8288958072662354

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.220
As the name suggests, what magnifier does the best is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8288958072662354

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:19.049
magnification.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8762345314025879

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.553
It makes part or all of your screen look bigger

NOTE Confidence: 0.8762345314025879

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.820
so you can see words and images better.

NOTE Confidence: 0.870392382144928

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.558
You got it right. Such a functionality would be very

NOTE Confidence: 0.870392382144928

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.855
useful for people with a certain kind of visual disability,

NOTE Confidence: 0.870392382144928

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.899
namely low vision.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8378404974937439

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.222
However, with new functionalities added to it, magnifier is now

NOTE Confidence: 0.8378404974937439

00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:41.101
even useful for people with total visual disability, color blindness

NOTE Confidence: 0.8378404974937439

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:42.170
and even dyslexia.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.537
And Edge is the case of most accessible tools and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:49.459
technologies. This can help each one of us in some

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:52.267
situations, like when we are in a video call and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:55.132
text in a document shared on the screen is barely

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.767
legible due to a very small font size used in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039708971977234

00:00:57.825 --> 00:00:58.569
the document.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7988664507865906

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.930
Let's try to know magnifier better.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8873642683029175

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.363
In Windows 11, Magnifier is available in accessibility, which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8873642683029175

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:09.249
part of Windows settings.

NOTE Confidence: 0.832171618938446

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.554
If you go to accessibility pane you will see magnifier

NOTE Confidence: 0.832171618938446

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:15.340
listed here and if you click here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7597580552101135

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.588
This magnifier window will open wherein there is a toggle

NOTE Confidence: 0.7597580552101135

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.079
button.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225461840629578

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.002
Through which you can launch or close magnifier. If I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225461840629578

00:01:24.062 --> 00:01:27.185
click on this one, magnifier will appear. So this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225461840629578

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.308
one way of launching magnifier and you can see that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225461840629578

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:31.749
wherever my mouse goes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361766934394836

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.250
This lens shows.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672304153442383

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.080
Any objects or text around that in a larger size.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9280938506126404

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.650
If I want to switch it off, I can just.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492248058319092

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.773
Click here and then magnifier goes away. So that is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492248058319092

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:50.302
one way of opening magnifier. Another way is to click

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492248058319092

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:53.440
on the search button. Type magnifier word here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396548628807068

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.031
And in the search results you can see magnifier icon.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396548628807068

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.618
Click on this one and now magnifier will appear. Here

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396548628807068

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.807
you can see that wherever my mouse goes you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396548628807068

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.329
see the objects around that and a larger size inside

NOTE Confidence: 0.8396548628807068

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.059
this lens.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.757
So this is second way of opening or launching magnifier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:17.418
There is another and in fact simplest way of opening

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:21.493
this which is to use keyboard shortcuts called Windows and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:25.016
plus on your keyboard. So when I press windows and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:28.538
magnifier appears and now you can see that this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:32.061
showing me things in a magnified manner. If I want

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.445
to switch it off I can also use another keyboard

NOTE Confidence: 0.8384247422218323

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:38.069
shortcut which is Windows and escape.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629764914512634

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.252
Now magnifier has different views which means that it can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629764914512634

00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:47.985
take up different shapes or forms, which are a full

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629764914512634

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:51.431
screen view, a lens view and a docked view. Let

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629764914512634

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:54.662
me show you how they work. But before that I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629764914512634

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:58.970
have to launch magnifier by pressing Windows and plus keys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7951928973197937

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.206
So the magnifier appears here in the lens view because

NOTE Confidence: 0.7951928973197937

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.693
that was the last view that I used while using

NOTE Confidence: 0.7951928973197937

00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:08.510
magnifier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8527501821517944

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.238
So this is lens view but if I want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8527501821517944

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.958
change two full screen view I need to use keyboard

NOTE Confidence: 0.8527501821517944

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.239
shortcuts which are control plus alt plus F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9040080904960632

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.960
When I do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9005021452903748

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.422
You can see that now I'm in full screen mode

NOTE Confidence: 0.9005021452903748

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:27.962
for magnifier and now wherever I take my mouse cursor,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9005021452903748

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:29.699
things will appear larger.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148752689361572

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.169
If these are in the size of these objects, still

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148752689361572

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.200
not large enough.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7379893064498901

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.053
To suit my requirements I can press windows in plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.7379893064498901

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.090
to magnify this further.

NOTE Confidence: 0.859561026096344

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.556
Like this if I want to go back to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.859561026096344

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.440
smaller size I can press windows and minus keys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7702069282531738

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.040
To reduce the zoom level.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801108002662659

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.127
So this is the second view which is called full

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801108002662659

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:57.331
screen view. But there is another view which is called

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801108002662659

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.709
docked view. How do you activate that by pressing control

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801108002662659

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:01.700
plus alt plus D?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.128
So now you can see that when I do that,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.723
this small box appears on my desktop. And now this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:12.459
works exactly in the same manner like the lens view.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:16.124
Wherever I take my mouse cursor they will appear in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:19.437
a larger size. Inside this box I can also dock

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:22.045
it on top of my window or I can dock

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:24.935
it to the left or right of my desktop as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:29.023
well. I can also inverse the colors, for example somebody

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821877241134644

00:04:29.094 --> 00:04:32.829
is not able to properly focus on the screen properly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8474346399307251

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.676
Be able to read the text. Because of certain color

NOTE Confidence: 0.8474346399307251

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:40.796
related issues, they can use the feature to invert the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8474346399307251

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.670
colors inside magnifier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7972710728645325

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.239
They just need to use a shortcut key called control

NOTE Confidence: 0.7972710728645325

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.679
plus Alt Plus I for the purpose control ALT Plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.7972710728645325

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.889
I.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6978505253791809

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.960
Which inverts the colors.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997675776481628

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.537
I can go back to the original view by pressing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997675776481628

00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:58.569
control plus, Alt Plus I once again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8352192044258118

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.962
There is another functionality in Magnifier now, which is its

NOTE Confidence: 0.8352192044258118

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.689
ability to read out text.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505513668060303

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.179
To activate its read text capabilities, you need to just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505513668060303

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.419
press a shortcut key, which is control plus ALT plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505513668060303

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.979
enter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8340293169021606

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.820
Magnifier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8940294981002808

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.710
Now you can see that it is reading that out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8926643133163452

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.077
So this was Windows magnifier. If you want to leverage

NOTE Confidence: 0.8926643133163452

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:29.197
this tool, don't forget to press windows and plus keys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8926643133163452

00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:29.809
Thank you.
